        <title>Debugging Parameters</title>

        <p>There are a variety of command-line string parameters (<xref ref="processing-publisher-stringparam"/>) for use by developers testing new code or diagnosing problems.  As of 2021-02-14 we are collecting their definitions in the <c>pretext-common.xsl</c> stylesheet early on.  Search on <c>debug.</c> to find them.  Elsewhere the names might be a bit more variable until we get them all rounded up in one place, but usually the name contains <c>debug</c> somewhere.  No documentation here, these are not documented (or stable), and only intended for authors as a stop-gap measure before being replaced in function.  Read the code for more, while some more permanent versions will be mentioned in this part.</p>
